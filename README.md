# Azure-Animal-Rescue-Pipeline
End-to-end Azure Cloud Data Engineering pipeline using Databricks, Delta Lake, Snowflake &amp; Power BI analyzing London Fire Brigade animal rescue operations.


# Azure Animal Rescue Data Pipeline

Transforming emergency animal rescue data into life-saving insights

# What This Project Does

A complete end-to-end Cloud Data Engineering Pipeline using real London Fire Brigade animal rescue data:

Azure Blob Storage → Databricks → Snowflake → Power BI

Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)

Automated data cleaning, validation & analytics export

Business insights to support faster, cheaper rescue operations

# Tech Stack


Azure · Databricks · PySpark · Delta Lake · Snowflake · Power BI · GitHub

# Key Insights Delivered (Gold Layer)

✅ Most rescued animals
✅ Top boroughs needing support
✅ Year-by-year rescue trends
✅ Cost of different rescue operations
✅ Annual budget performance tracking

All published as Parquet for BI & warehousing.

# What I Solved

 # Real Data Engineering challenges:

| Challenge                       | Achievement                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Schema errors & type mismatches | Strong data validation & casting           |
| Datetime parsing failures       | Reliable timestamp conversions             |
| Cloud storage permissions       | Secure ABFSS + SAS authentication          |
| Mounting blocked                | Switched to direct Azure filesystem access |
| Snowflake integration           | External tables from Blob Storage          |

No task failed twice — every error became a skill.

✅ Current Status

✔ Architecture complete
✔ Analytics generated
✔ Snowflake connected


# Why This Project Matters

This pipeline helps emergency responders save more animals
through better visibility on where, why and what rescues happen.

Data saving lives — literally.
